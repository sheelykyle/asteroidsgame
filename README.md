### ASTEROIDS PROJECT ###
This is a python project exploring object-oriented programming via a Boot.dev course. While they provided the incremental plan and some of the vector code, I created the large bulk of this code and repository.

When run, the program will:
 - allow you to pilot a polygon ship across a black screen using WASD
 - spawn asteroids of varying size, direction, and speed
 - allow you to shoot at the asteroids by pressing the SPACEBAR
 - eliminating asteroids if they're small enough or breaking them into smaller asteroids if they are larger
 - ending the game if your ship collides with an asteroid

In the future, I plan to add the following to the game:
 - a scoring system
 - multiple lives and a respawning mechanism
 - an explosion effect for the asteroids
 - acceleration to player movement
 - wraparound effect for objects on the screen instead of disappearing
 - a background image or perhaps Matrix-style coloration
 - different weapon types
 - lumpy asteroids
 - a triangular hit box for the ship (currently has a circular one)
 - shield and speed powerups
 - bombs
